This particular neuron will generally not send any spikes in the dark, and this neuron will send spikes if you shine green light (e.g. at wavelength 550 nm) on it. Let's also assume that we have a recording electrode near the soma (the point where this neuron sends spikes). Through this electrode, we can record when this neuron is firing over time. \n",
